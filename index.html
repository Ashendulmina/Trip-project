    <h2>Pahiyangala Cave</h2>
    <p>Pahiyangala Cave is Located in District Of Kalutara,Western Province,Sri Lanka. It is also said during historical times a buddhist monk named "Fa-Shien" lived in the cave. However, there is no archaeological or historical evidence to support that. Nonetheless, the site is of archaeological significance as Late Pleistocene human fossilized skeletal remains were discovered in the cave's sediments during excavations in the 1960s, the 1980s and in 2013. This is the largest natural stone cave in South Asia. 3500 people can stay here at the same time. To see the size of the cave, you have to go inside and look outside. Humans have lived here for 35000-60000 years.They used sea fish, salt, and shark teeth as ornaments. This limestone was formed by corrosion over hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

  <h2>Kukulegaga Power Station</h2>
  <p>The Kukule Ganga Dam is a 110 m dam built across the Kukule River in Kalawana, Sri Lanka. the dam feeds an underground hydroelectric power station located approximately 5 kilometres away, via tunnel. Water from the tunnel is fed into the 80 MegaWatt underground power station, consisting of two 40 MegaWatt units. This capacity was intentionally limited to 70 MegaWatt due to load issues. The power station generates an average of 317 GigaWatt per hour annually. Two transformers step up the voltage of the power generated to 132 kV, which is then transferred to the national grid at the Mathugama Substation, via a 27 kilometres long 132 kV double-circuit transmission line.</p>
